THE LAST <unk> FORTUNE FORTUNE CHAPTER I OF MY JOURNEY TO THE PLAIN AS I left the place of my birth and long <unk> and took the road to that far country where I thought my fortune lay , the sun already had a countenance .
It was shining on the <unk> trees ; on the tall white walls of the house of justice at the corner of the square ; on the worthy priest who was <unk> holy water on the steps of the monastery of the <unk> <unk> to suppress the dust , to keep away the flies , and to <unk> the <unk> ; and especially on the only <unk> that our town could boast , whose <unk> <unk> with the thieves he <unk> .
He , honest fellow , had driven so poor a trade of late that he crept along in his winter coat , seeking the shade of trees and houses .
Even at this time some portion of philosophy had gone to the increase of my mind , a habit which sprang , I think , from my mother ’ s <unk> brother Nicolas was a clerk of Salamanca and wore a purple gown .
So when it fell to consider two such matters as the <unk> of rogues and the sun ’ s majestic clemency it found a pleasant argument .
I had yet to adventure half a league into the world , but unless my eyes were false , the place I had vowed to win was fair and full of virtue .
Having such thoughts I rejoiced exceedingly .
Thus I checked my horse a moment and , <unk> up my eyes to heaven , was fain to <unk> the morning .
However , as I made to pursue my way , <unk> with the generosity of my youth , my gaze was diverted by a thing of pity .
It was an old poor woman sitting beside a door .
She was thin and feeble .
Her cheeks were hollow , there was no lustre in her glance , her mouth had not a tooth ; but her face was such that I felt unable to pass her by .
My father had an adage pertinent to her case .
“ Be kind to the poor , ” said the first of mankind , “ and if you are not the happiest man in Spain , it is a conspiracy of Fortune ’ s . ” As I approached this aged creature I saw she had an eye which seemed to ask an alms yet did disdain it ; and this war of pride and necessity in a poor beggar woman , halt and lean , led me to consider that she was not of the common sort , but had had a birth perhaps , and upon a day had known the cushions of prosperity .
And this fancy moved my heart indeed , for in my view there is no more pitiful sight in nature than a blood Arab so broken in his wind and circumstances as to be <unk> to base <unk> .
There were only ten crowns in my purse , but its <unk> were <unk> before I could consider of my private need .
<unk> to her as solemnly as if she had been the daughter of a <unk> who shall say that she was not ? --I begged her to accept a tenth part of my inheritance .
She received this invitation with those <unk> eyes that so much enhance her sex ; while such confusion overcame the gentle soul that a minute passed before her <unk> hand could draw a <unk> from the bag I held before her .
I went on my way with no more than nine crowns in my possession .
Now , it is no light thing , believe me , reader , for a youth of one-and-twenty to adventure into an unknown country , upon a quest of fortune on a mountain horse , in the company of a sword of an ancient pattern , a leather jerkin laced with steel , a hat without a feather , and the sum of nine crowns , neither more nor less , for the whole of his estate .
I had set the nose of Babieca in the direction of the south .
At first my way was taken through a pleasant country of great hills , that had cork trees on their slopes .
Here and there little rivers ran in and out ; sparkling in the morning sun ; shining on the side of some tall mountain ; <unk> round the foot of some grave precipice .
But as the morning passed , and as hour by hour I went farther from my native hills , the nature of the land was changed .
The cool <unk> and streams , the rich green pastures , and the fine tall hills with their <unk> of dark <unk> yielded to a barren plain , to which , alas !
there appeared to be no end .
It was bare and <unk> , and strewn in many places with sharp rocks .
There was not a tree , not a stream of water ; and such horrid quantities of sand consumed it that it became at last a desert whose life was <unk> .
A few barren <unk> were the only things that grew there ; and , as I was soon to learn , an infinite degree of misery .
All this time the sun was rising in the sky , and when about the hour of noon it began to beat from a naked heaven whose face was brass , upon the <unk> plain , this wilderness grew so fierce and <unk> as hardly to be borne .
<unk> upon mile I did <unk> and stoutly overcame ; but horizon <unk> to horizon , each so bright and <unk> with heat that the eye was afeared to meet it , each so bare , so flat , and so like the one that was before , <unk> sand on every side and <unk> fire everywhere , with never a prospect of shelter or abode , and so small a hope of change , that at last I began to <unk> from the path I was determined on , and was even led to think this must be the high road to <unk> .
Even before noon my mouth was <unk> like a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> my tongue , but no spring was there to <unk> it ; nor was there a house to be seen .
Indeed , the sun was become almost as cruel as he was formerly gentle , sitting in heaven like a ball of fire , and seeming to take pleasure from his pitiless descent on the coarse suit of a sanguine colour of one Miguel Jesus Maria de Sarda y Boegas .
And to increase the evil of my case my person was now taken with a pestilence of flies .
These <unk> creatures bit my face and neck so <unk> that the <unk> of my person spread into my mind ; whereon it rose to such a height against them as to provoke as round a fume of swearing as that of any rapscallion of the towns .
Perforce I had to check this froward disposition in myself ; for it is intolerable in one who <unk> that his fortitude shall overcome the world , to find himself put out of countenance by the meanest <unk> in it .
It is no part of valour for a man to break and <unk> before an enemy , but the sun was now so much against me that I was fain to seek a refuge from him .
Indeed , necessity was like to drive me to it all too soon , for there was already a kind of sickness <unk> in my brain .
So a little in the afternoon I saw through the fiery haze that trembled above the plain , a piece of <unk> that promised a <unk> .
I turned my horse towards it with more alacrity than credit , though I am sure that had Cæsar himself been mounted that afternoon on my patient Babieca he must have <unk> even as did I , however the stoutness of his heart had cried out on the weakness of his nature .
I led Babieca into as much shade as I could devise , tied him to a bush , and crawled under it with my unlucky brains .
While taking refuge here I had a fall in fortune .
You will conceive , O admirable reader !
that the sun , this false friend in whom I had reposed my trust , having dealt with me in this false spirit , there was no longer that poetry in my temper with which I had begun my journey .
I was beset with doubts .
If a face so bright , so open , so <unk> could hide such <unk> , where was the candour of the world ?
By this pertinent reflection my thoughts were carried to the poor woman who had also shared my trust .
Perchance it was not the part of wisdom to bestow the tenth portion of my inheritance upon a beggar in the road .
<unk> considering this aspect of the case I took forth my pouch , and pouring my little means into my hand , not without a pang that one palm could hold it all , behold !
in lieu of nine crowns I discovered that I had but eight .
Now , I was never afraid to believe that if a man hold a low opinion of his kind , and looks upon them in a spirit of askance , such a one is fit for no nice company , since he merits no more consideration than he is willing to bestow .
But to find that my trust had been abused so <unk> gravelled me altogether .
I could have wept for the <unk> trick and cried out upon the world .
Nor would I have you to consider that it was a piece of <unk> that led me to this mind .
It was the plausibility , the cold <unk> that <unk> me like a dagger .
I had hoped to carry upon my <unk> that good faith towards my fellows that my noble father had bade me entertain .
It was to be my solace and my watchword .
As I rode forth the <unk> of the morning were to breathe it in my ears ; at night I was to lie down in its security underneath the stars .
“ <unk> is a thing so excellent that this peerless world was made for his demesne . ” Thus Don Ygnacio , and he was threescore years and seven when he perished of the stone .
Was the seed of that true caballero to renounce a wisdom so mature because of a blow received by misadventure ?
Some hours I lay in security , for I was in mortal fear of the ball of fire above my head .
By a good chance I had placed a <unk> of <unk> bread and a piece of cheese made of <unk> ’ s milk in my wallet .
This I munched with discretion , for there was never a house to be seen , and this <unk> plain appeared to stretch many miles .
There was no spring at which to <unk> my thirst , and during long hours I was <unk> dreadfully .
My tongue and throat were blistered by the heat that arose from the burning sand .
<unk> did I <unk> that I had not had the wisdom to <unk> a skin of water to my saddle .
By the time the fury of the sun had grown somewhat less my head had recovered of its stroke , and I got upon my road .
Nor was it in any bitterness of spirit that I went , for I had taken a solace from my <unk> which reconciled me to the <unk> of my patrimony .
It should call for more than a single mischance to break my faith in my brothers of the mountains and my cousins of the plains .
Many a weary mile did I make ere the sun went down and a little pity for the <unk> entered the firmament .
My eyes did ache with the glare of the burning yellow ground ; my body was sorely painful with the fatigues of travel ; and when at last the sun was gone and the night and its stars appeared I gazed <unk> on every hand for the sign of some <unk> to which I might commit my distress .
But there was never a poor inn nor a <unk> ’ s hut to be seen in all this wilderness .
The night found me greatly doubtful of my way .
I kept Babieca ’ s head as fair to the south as I could reckon , but in the faint light of the stars a true course was difficult to point .
Nor was it without its dangers , for the road was of a wretched nature .
It was strewn with sharp-pointed boulders , sand , <unk> grasses , and was full of holes .
<unk> it led I did not know .
But I had been told , or perhaps had <unk> , that many famous cities lay before me buried in the mists of night .
They were marked in my imagination as the <unk> of every splendid enterprise , of every fortunate endeavour ; and beyond all else , of the fairest peoples of the fairest countries of the world .
It was very dark , but soon I saw these cities stretching out before me in the night .
They were truly delectable to see ; fair places all , with the morning beams upon a crowd of palaces , castles of a noble situation , large , white , and lofty churches built of stone , and a company of <unk> .
I saw the sea , which was only known to me by rumour , that broad <unk> to the <unk> and other foreign lands where fame and riches wait on boldness and can be picked like <unk> from beneath the trees .
I saw the <unk> , a dark yet <unk> azure , which were said to ride a thousand <unk> , filled with men of valour .
I could see their friends upon the <unk> waving their <unk> .
And I know not what <unk> then swept over me , for no sooner did I observe the people in this fantasy than I remembered I had not a friend in all the world save Babieca , patient <unk> and poor mountain creature that he was , and he was <unk> like the stones upon the road .
I felt the tears rising in my heart , and though I fought against them they were <unk> <unk> not easy to suppress .
For I cannot say with what <unk> I <unk> at this dark hour for one glance from the eyes of him who was alive but a week ago .
My way was very lonely then , having strayed remote into a distant country .
And very lonely was my heart ; yet to those who will overpass my boldness I will confide it faltered not in resolution and therefore was not cold .
For through all the long season of his adversity my father had <unk> : “ <unk> is a living fire in a winter ’ s night . ” Thus when the evening winds arose and <unk> my body I pressed on , though I knew not whither , and had no thought of return .
<unk> came and hours went , and I had a great despair of <unk> for myself and willing beast ; and I had such a <unk> that it was no virtue of my own that held the reins .
My belly was as bare as was this wilderness , yet my heart was fixed against complaint .
I pressed forward <unk> until at last Babieca began to <unk> at every yard he took .
Upon that both of us came to one mind .
We could go no farther .
I was seeking for a tree whose <unk> might afford some protection from the shrewd airs of the night , and in such a desert a tree was hard to find , when I thought I discerned a light a great way off .
I cannot tell you , reader , in what a tumult of hope I made towards this beacon .
It showed across the waste so <unk> that at first it looked no more than the <unk> <unk> .
Yet we had no other hope than this .
<unk> words to the hapless Babieca and shaking of the reins persuaded the good beast still to do his best .
And presently these doubts were settled , for as we pressed on towards our talisman we found it to proceed from a sort of house .
Thereupon I could have cried aloud for joy , in such a manner had hunger , weariness , and <unk> wrought upon the <unk> of my <unk> .
It was no easy task to find the place whence this light proceeded .
And when at last I was able to learn I uttered a cry of delight .
For it was an inn ; a little inn and paltry , and yet the sweetest inn , I think , to which a traveller ever brought his weariness .
CHAPTER II OF AN INN .
OF A MAN FROM FOREIGN PARTS ON coming at last to the door I found this wayside inn to be of a mean condition , but at least it had four walls to it , and therefore might be called an inn .
Such as it was it promised food and rest and the society of man .
Observing a stable to be near at hand I led Babieca to it .
A wretched hovel it was , yet it also had four walls of a sort and therefore might be called a stable .
Although no one came out of the inn to receive me and a great air of <unk> was upon everything , I led Babieca within the hovel and contrived to find him a place in which he might repose .
After much <unk> in the <unk> light there was <unk> came through the holes in the mud walls I was able to <unk> enough straw together to form his bed .
Also I was able to find him a supper of rough fare .
And in so doing I observed that this poor place was in the occupation of a horse of a singular appearance .
As well as I could learn in the darkness this was a very tall , <unk> , and handsome beast , sleek and highly fed .
<unk> to it , hanging upon a nail in the wall , was a saddle so massive of artifice and so rarely <unk> as to indicate that both this piece of furniture and the beast that bore it were in such a degree above the common sort as doubtless to be the property of a lord .
And this conclusion pleased me very well ; for I was glad to believe that one of his condition had lent his presence to this mean place , because there is no need to tell you , gentle reader , a man of birth needs one of a similar quality with whom to <unk> his leisure .
As I <unk> , however , from the stable and made to enter the inn I was stayed at the door by a dismal rustic who proved to be the landlord .
His bearing was of such singular dejection and in his countenance was such sore embarrassment as to make it clear that either a grievous calamity had lately befallen him or that one was about to do so .
“ I give you good evening , honest fellow .
Have you seen a ghost ? ” The dismal wight placed a finger to his lip .
“ <unk> , sir !
hush , I pray you ! ” he whispered <unk> .
“ Nay , my good fellow , I hush for no <unk> is , unless you have a corpse in the house . ” “ I have worse than a corpse in the house , ” said the innkeeper , crossing himself .
“ Worse than a corpse ? ” “ Yes , kind gentleman , a thousand times worse !
How shall I speak it ?
I have the Devil . ” The innkeeper made a <unk> groan .
“ I can hardly believe that , ” said I.
“ He is not often seen in Spain nowadays . ” “ Yes , it ’ s the Devil right enough , ” said the innkeeper , wiping his eyes on the sleeve of his jerkin .
“ I am a ruined man . ” “ How does he seem in appearance ?
Are there horns on his head and does fire proceed out of his mouth ? ” “ He has an eye , ” said the innkeeper .
In spite of my incredulity I could not help <unk> a little .
“ The evil eye , your worship , the <unk> d ’ <unk> .
And he is so enormous !
When he rises from his stool his head goes into the roof . ” “ Peace , honest fellow , ” I said stoutly .
“ The age of monsters is <unk> . ” “ <unk> ! ” <unk> the innkeeper , “ your worship is in the wrong entirely .
You can form no conception of what a fiend is this . ” “ There have been no monsters in Spain since the time of the Cid , ” said I , <unk> my hand on my sword .
“ I tell you this is the fiend , ” said the innkeeper <unk> .
“ He is hugeous , gigantical ; and when he <unk> his porridge he <unk> like a horse .
Three weeks has he lain upon me like the pestilence .
He has picked my larder bare , and <unk> by his beard he ’ ll treat my bones the same if I do not use him like an <unk> .
He has <unk> all the choice red wine out of my skins into his <unk> cursed one .
He <unk> his <unk> if a man so much as looks upon him twice .
All my custom is <unk> to the wind .
_ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ! _ His mouth is <unk> with barbarous expressions .
And he has an eye . ” In spite of my father ’ s sword and the natural resolution that goes with my name and province the strange excitement of the landlord made me thrill all over .
“ It is the eye of the fiend , ” he said .
“ It <unk> red like a coal ; it is hungry like a vulture ’ s , fierce like a wolf ’ s .
And then his <unk> is like an <unk> in the mountains .
Oh , your worship , it is <unk> in person who has come to <unk> my hair ! ” I reproved the poor rustic for this levity .
“ Nay , your worship , I speak the truth , ” he said miserably .
“ The good God knows it is so .
I am a ruined man .
The Devil has lain three weeks in my house , yet I have not received a cuarto for his <unk> .
A lion could not be so <unk> .
He has <unk> lean meat , fat meat , not to mention goodly <unk> .
He has drunk wine enough to rot his soul .
Ten men together could not use their fangs like he and roar so loud , yet I assure your worship I have not received so much as a cuarto . ” “ This matter is certainly grievous , ” said I.
“ Is there nothing you can do to get this person out of your house ? ” “ Nothing , nothing , ” said the innkeeper miserably .
“ Why , sir , I offered him the whole of the profits I made last <unk> less than the sum of ten <unk> go away from my inn before ruin had come upon me .
He took my money , and said he would bring his mind to bear upon the subject . ” “ Was your course a wise one ? ” “ It may have been wise , your worship , and yet it may not .
For upon bringing his mind to bear upon the subject , he said he had <unk> to <unk> his visit by ten days ; but as he is lying upon me still , it appears uncommonly like it that honest Pedro has had dealings with a villain . ” “ That is as may be , ” said I ; “ but the good Don Ygnacio de Sarda y Boegas , who died a week ago of the stone , would have no man judged harshly until his conduct had been carefully <unk> . ” “ If Don Ygnacio was as good as you say , I expect he never had the Devil in person <unk> his porridge at the side of his chimney . ” “ No , by my faith .
But are you not calling this unlucky individual out of his true character ? ” “ Well , your worship , it is like this , do you see , ” said the innkeeper humbly ; “ poor Pedro once had the misfortune to <unk> a horse . ” “ You stole a horse , and yet you were not hanged ! ” “ No , your worship ; they hanged my poor son in error .
But perchance , if I <unk> my breast of this misfortune , it may please the Virgin Mary to lessen my <unk> . ” “ If you are a wise man you will also burn a <unk> or two .
But , innkeeper , I will enter this venta of yours and speak with your guest , whoever he may be .
For myself , I don ’ t put much faith in the black arts . ” I confess that our <unk> of these unnatural affairs had provoked strange feelings .
But I spoke as boldly as I could , and laid my hand on the hilt of my sword with so much determination that the poor wight of an innkeeper fell into a violent trembling .
“ Oh no , your worship , ” he cried ; “ I would have you go upon your road .
He is so prompt to violence that he will certainly slay you if you so much as show him your eyes . ” “ That is as may be , ” said I , taking a <unk> grip upon my sword .
“ Oh , your worship , ” said the innkeeper , “ I pray you use him <unk> .
I <unk> you be gentle of your discourse .
He would <unk> the nails of the Cid .
He fills the world with <unk> as easily as a <unk> fills a house with fleas . ” “ You must obey me , innkeeper , ” I said sternly , but without anger I hope , for the state of the poor fellow ’ s mind had moved me to pity .
“ You must remember that a caballero of my province is afeared only of God . ” The unlucky wight , finding that I was not to be <unk> , led the way , with many misgivings , into his <unk> house .
There was only one apartment for the service of guests .
It was a poor one enough , with hardly anything in it except the <unk> on the walls and three candles which <unk> <unk> .
Such a hovel was only fit for the entertainment of pigs , <unk> , and <unk> ; yet it was not its quality that first awoke my attention .
Neither was it the extremely singular personage that was seated at the side of the fire .
It was the delicious smell of cookery that filled the whole place .
This proceeded out of a great <unk> pot that hung in the chimney .
To one who had travelled all day nothing could have been more delectable .
At its sight and <unk> my hunger began to protest fiercely , for my last piece of victual had been eaten at noon .
<unk> on a low stool , as near to the pot as he might venture without being <unk> in the legs , I found the author of these <unk> .
His gaze was <unk> upon this delicious kettle .
His enormous limbs were outstretched across the hearth , a rare cup of liquor was beside his stool , and so <unk> was he gazing at the meat as it <unk> and hissed in the cauldron that upon my entrance he did not stir , but , without so much as removing his chin from his hands , continued in his occupation with an air of approval and <unk> .
For myself , I <unk> him with a long and grave look .
Since that distant evening in my youth I have met with many <unk> and adventures in my travels .
I have fallen in with persons of all <unk> virtuous , the wicked , and those who are neither one nor the other .
I have broken bread with princes , <unk> , rogues , <unk> , and men of the <unk> of all nations and of every variety of <unk> I believe never one so remarkable as he who now kept the chimney of this wretched venta upon a three-legged stool .
The length of his limbs was extraordinary ; his shoulders were those of a giant ; and even in his present careless and <unk> attitude he wore an uncommonly sinister and formidable look .
His dress at one time would scarcely have come amiss to a prince , yet now it was barely <unk> from that of a beggar .
The original colour of his doublet , which hung in tatters , was an orange <unk> , but it was now so <unk> and <unk> that it could have stood for any hue one cared to name .
His cloak , which hung upon the wall , was of a bright blue camlet , and was but little superior to the condition of his doublet .
<unk> silk had once formed the substance of his hose , but now the better part of it was cloth , having suffered many <unk> with that material .
<unk> to such <unk> marks of <unk> , his long yellow riding boots were <unk> in pieces , one even revealed the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> ; whilst his scabbard was in such case as it sprawled on the ground beside his leg that the naked point was visible .
When I came near and fell to regard him the better , he did me the honour to lift his left eye off the cooking-pot .
He proceeded to <unk> at me in a manner of the most <unk> indifference , and yet of the greatest insolence imaginable .
Then , without saying a word , he yawned in my face and turned the whole of his attention again to the kettle .
Such a piece of sauciness made me feel angry .
Had I been a dog I could not have been met with less civility .
My hand went again to the hilt of my sword as I took a closer view of his visage .
It was as red as <unk> , shining with cunning and the love of the cup .
But it was the eye he had fixed upon me that gave me the most concern .
The poor innkeeper was right when he spoke of his eye .
It was as rude as a tiger ’ s , and animated with such a hungry look that it might have belonged to a <unk> who desired to know what sort of meal stood before him .
<unk> I might be in doubt as to what was his <unk> , whether it was that of a lord or a <unk> , since his assemblance <unk> that he partook of both these conditions , I had no doubt at all that he was not a Spanish <unk> where should you find a caballero of our most courteous nation who would so soil his manners as to treat a stranger with this degree of <unk> ?
Yet there was a great air of possession about him as he sat his stool , as though every stick and <unk> of the inn was his own private furniture , so that I almost felt that I was <unk> within his castle .
There was , again , that insolence in his looks as clearly implied that it was his habit to command a deal of consideration from the world ; and as a lord is a lord in every land , whether he happen to be a Spaniard or a German Goth , I opened , like a <unk> , in the lightest manner , not to provoke offence , for I trust that Miguel Jesus Maria de Sarda y Boegas has ever too much respect for his <unk> to humiliate a man of birth .
“ I give the greeting of God to your excellency , ” I began , <unk> myself and bowing low , as became a hidalgo of my nation .
The occupant of the stool made no sign that I had addressed him , except that he spat in the fire .
“ May it please you , <unk> thousand pardons , ” said I ; “ but I have heard a tale of you from the keeper of this inn that never did consist with <unk> .
And may I pray you to have it rectified , for the poor fellow is sorely afflicted in his understanding . ” At this address the occupant of the stool took his left eye off the cooking-pot for the second time , and fixed it upon me slowly and <unk> , and said in a rude , foreign accent that was an offence to my ears , “ Yes , my son , pray me by all means ; or <unk> me , or <unk> me , or do with me just as you please .
I have grown old in the service of virtue , yet perhaps I ought to mention that I have not so much as the price of a pot of small ale in my poke . ” “ By your leave , sir , you are upon some <unk> , ” said I.
“ It is not your money that I crave , but your civility . ” “ <unk> , my son .
Well , I dare say I can arrange for as much of that as you require . ” “ It is pleasing to know that , sir .
But this <unk> <unk> not appear to have <unk> of it . ” The occupant of the stool took my remonstrance in fairer part than there was reason to expect .
Indeed he even abated his manners into some appearance of politeness .
“ You appear to judge shrewdly for one of your years , my young companion , ” he said , in a voice that fell quite soft .
“ But if I must speak the truth , this innkeeper is a notorious villain ; and if I am ever civil to a notorious villain , I hope Heaven will correct me . ” “ Even upon such a matter as that , sir , ” I said gravely , “ there may be two sorts of opinion .
Even if this poor innkeeper is not so virtuous as he might be , it will not help him on the true path to be mulcted in his substance . ” “ By cock ! ” said the occupant of the stool , “ it is an old head you wear on your shoulders , my young companion .
You speak to a point .
I can tell you have been to <unk> . ” “ Sir , you are mistaken in this , although I come of a good family upon the side of both my <unk> .
My uncle Nicolas is <unk> in the university of Salamanca ; and as for my father , lately <unk> , he was one of the wisest men that ever lived . ” “ Yes , I can see that , ” said the occupant of the stool , whose voice had fallen <unk> than ever .
“ It is as plain as my hand . ” <unk> curiously , and perhaps with a little of the vanity of youth , I sought a reason for this <unk> .
“ It is as plain as the gown of a woman of virtue , ” he said , with a stealthy <unk> glance .
“ I have a wonderful eye for merit .
You can never disguise birth and condition from one like myself .
I am a former clerk of Oxford , and my lineage is such that modesty forbids me to name it before supper . ” “ Oxford , ” said I , taking this quaint , barbarous name upon my tongue with pain .
“ <unk> your presence , sir , what part of our great peninsula is that ?
It sounds not unlike the province of Galicia , where I know the dialect and the people are allowed to be a little uncivil . ” “ Not too quickly , my son .
The university of Oxford is about a day ’ s journey from the centre of the world . ” “ Then , sir , it must be <unk> in Castile . ” “ Why Castile , my son ? ” “ Madrid is in the province of Castile , and that , I believe , is <unk> reckoned to be the centre of the world . ” “ My young companion , I sit corrected , ” said the occupant of the stool , with a humble air that went not at all well with his countenance .
“ When I was young I was always taught that the centre of the world was London ; but I dare say the world has moved on a little since those days . ” “ London , sir ! ” said I ; for here was another barbarous word I had never heard before .
“ I pray you tell me in what part of our peninsula is London . ” Instead of <unk> to this question , the occupant of the stool began to purse his lips in an odd manner , and to <unk> his chin with his forefinger .
“ By my soul , ” he said , “ that is a plaguy odd question to address to an English gentleman ! ” “ Doubtless it may be , ” said I , “ to one who has travelled much , and knows our great peninsula from one end to the other ; but I confess I never left my native province before this morning . ” “ Never left your province before this morning ! ” said this strange person , laughing softly .
“ Is it conceivable ?
If you had kept it close it would have required great wisdom to suspect it .
Your mind has been <unk> , my young companion , and your air is so finished that I should like to see it at the court of Sophy . ” I was fain to bow at so much civility .
Yet he was laughing softly all the while , and there was a <unk> look in his eye that I <unk> .
“ Would you say that I had been drinking , ” said he , “ if I declare to you upon my honour that London never was in Spain at all ? ” “ I take it nowise amiss , sir ; yet if London is no part of Spain I fail to see how it can be the centre of the world . ” For the moment I feared this extraordinary man would fall from his stool , so <unk> did his laughter ascend to the roof .
I felt some <unk> , for surely such an action was no part of courtesy .
<unk> , however , that it is the first business of the polite to refrain from outfacing the rude with their own manners , I gathered all my patience and said , not without haughtiness , I fear : “ Sir , are you not from foreign parts ? ” “ Nay , my young son of the Spains , I am come to foreign parts , if that is your question .
I was born and bred in England ; I am the natural son of an English king ; I have dwelt in England half my years ; and when I die my bones shall lie in England , for since the time of Uthyr Pendragon , the respected <unk> of an English sovereign , no scion of my name has left his bones to rot in a foreign climate . ” “ England , ” said I ; “ the land is as strange to me as far <unk> . ” It was in vain that I strove to recall what I had heard of this remote island country .
Yet , as I could <unk> nothing whatever about it , I was fain to believe that I had never heard of it at all .
CHAPTER III OF THE EATING OF MEAT NO sooner had I made this confession than this remarkable man uttered a shout that filled the place like the report of a caliver .
“ By my hand , ” he cried , “ what a nation !
Have you ever heard of the moon , my son ? ” “ Certainly , sir , I have heard of the moon . ” “ Come now , he ’ s heard of the moon .
How learned they are getting in this cursed peninsula !
This must be one of the clergy . ” “ Yes , sir , ” I said with sternness , for the sauciness of his look was hard to <unk> ; “ I have heard of the moon continually ; and under your good favour I am willing to hear of this England of which you make mention .
Where may it be ? ” “ Well , to begin with , I could never learn that it was in Spain .
<unk> I have a <unk> to my prayers , that I may reward heaven for its good kindness . ” This incensed me greatly .
“ It must be a barbarous land this England , if I may judge by what it breeds , ” was my rejoinder .
“ <unk> indeed , ” said he .
“ There are more <unk> in England than there are honest men in this peninsula . ” “ You misunderstand me , sir , I am afraid . ” “ I hope I do misunderstand you , my son ; for if I do not , it would almost appear that you are a native of this damnable country . ” “ Mother of Jesus ! ” I cried , “ this is intolerable . ” Such a <unk> was beyond my patience ; and when I fell to consider that he who applied it to my country , was native to a land in which civilization had yet its work to <unk> had now a recollection that these English were a dreadful brawling people , a race of robbers who sold their swords for gain , and <unk> the whole of <unk> deemed it proper to indulge a <unk> against this foreigner whose demeanour was so rude .
“ Señor caballero , I fear I am under the necessity of having to correct you . ” I laid my hand on my sword with a dignified gesture .
“ By all means , young <unk> ’ <unk> . ” His harsh voice sank into a most remarkable <unk> softness .
“ I am ever open to correction , as becomes a good mother ’ s son who hath received it <unk> . ” “ Here , sir , and now , ” I cried <unk> , dragging my sword from its case .
While I had been speaking , the eyes of the barbarian had opened wider and wider , till at the moment I showed him my steel he opened his mouth and sent up such a <unk> of laughter to the hams , <unk> , and <unk> that <unk> the beams in the roof , as nearly provoked the poor innkeeper , who all this time had taken care to keep behind me , to take leave of his wits .
“ Why , if this is not a <unk> ” --he pressed his hands to his ribs and roared like a <unk> “ I am not a king ’ s son .
By the lord Harry , what a notable assemblance have we here !
By cock , how he doth spread his five feet nothing !
If he had but a beard under his chin , he might break an <unk> .
And look you , he holds his point as staunchly as old <unk> bears his <unk> in the Lord <unk> ’ s <unk> . ” “ On guard , sir , immediately ” --I advanced a step upon <unk> “ before I run you through the heart . ” Instead , however , of heeding my purpose , he continued to address most immoderate roars to the roof , and his huge frame <unk> on the stool like a <unk> in distress .
“ Why , there ’ s <unk> ! ” he roared .
“ The valiancy of the <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
By my good soul , I have never seen anything so terrible , unless it is a <unk> sitting under a <unk> with its ears spread , or a squirrel casting for <unk> in a scarce <unk> .
But here ’ s my hand , little <unk> <unk> .
Do you <unk> upon it like a good thing ; and I pray you , <unk> , do not preen your feathers like a <unk> , else a fluxion will mount in my brains and I shall spit blood . ” The enormous barbarian held his hand towards me , as though I were a small bird with feathers , and he puckered up his mouth , as if he would <unk> me to <unk> upon his forefinger .
He kept gazing at me sideways , and now and again would <unk> away his face and break into laughter the most unseemly .
I <unk> the point of my sword on the floor in the instancy of anger .
“ Feathers ! ” he cried .
“ By my good soul , they preen and <unk> like the back of a goose .
Why I would like to wear your <unk> in my bonnet and eat your grease in a <unk> . ” “ I am afraid you do not <unk> , sir , ” said I , striving to regain my composure , “ with whom you hold speech .
My name is Sarda ; and Don Ygnacio , my illustrious father , both by descent and nurture was one of the first of his native province of Asturias .
His family have served their country in a thousand ways , since the time of that Ruy Diaz whom we call familiarly the Cid . ” “ Is that so , good Don , is that really the case ? ” The Englishman averted his countenance .
“ Then if you are the <unk> of such an illustrious trunk , you must be nearly as full of high breeding as an elderly <unk> is full of dignity .
Good Master Don <unk> , I pray you do not make me laugh ; the best <unk> in the <unk> of Middlesex have <unk> me against <unk> of the brain and the <unk> of blood .
All the most accomplished minds of a pretty good house have died in that way . ” “ Sir Englishman , ” said I , “ I grieve for this demeanour which you display ; but the last of our name must follow the practice of his <unk> .
Your language is unseemly ; it is to be regretted ; the <unk> you have urged against my country cannot go <unk> . ” “ Oh , my young companion , ” said he , striving to be grave , yet failing to appear so , “ I am persuaded I shall die a horribly <unk> death . ” With might and main he strove to <unk> more worthily .
By taking infinite pains he was able at last to <unk> his coarse red features , <unk> with the cup and stained by the sun , into an appearance of respectfulness ; but the moment I <unk> him down went his chin , his enormous frame began to <unk> , and forth came another roar that <unk> along the <unk> like the <unk> of an <unk> .
Such conduct put me out of countenance completely .
Although my experience of the world was not such as to teach me how to meet it <unk> , I was determined that it should not go free .
I had a passion to run him through the body , but this could not be done while he continued to pay no regard to my sword .
Yet , as he was <unk> to those methods of courtesy that were the pride of my race , I determined to adopt a mode more extreme .
I was about to deal him a blow in the face with my hand , to bring him to a sense of his peril , when , like a wise fellow , the innkeeper made a diversion .
And this for the time being changed the current of affairs .
He fished a ham from the cooking-pot , and laid it on a dish .
No sooner did the Englishman discover this meat to be set against his elbow than out he whipped his dagger and fell upon it , being no more able to contain his inclination than are the beasts that perish .
Perforce , I had to put up my sword and abide in patience until this barbarian had <unk> his appetite .
But I had not reckoned well if I thought he would do this easily .
Never have I seen a man eat so rapidly , so grossly , so <unk> as this gigantical foreigner .
At last came a pause in this employ , whereupon he regarded me with the grease shining about his chaps .
“ Why , good Don , ” said he , “ you look a little sharp yourself .
You have travelled <unk> upon your <unk> , or I am a rogue .
You shouldn ’ t do it , my son , you shouldn ’ t do it .
<unk> be courteous to the belly , and you will find her <unk> .
<unk> her , good Don , and you will find her a jade .
Landlord , will you have the goodness to bring a platter for our friend of the feathers , or must I be put to the trouble of <unk> the point of my dagger into your <unk> Iberian skin ? ” The innkeeper , who appeared to have no desire to place the Englishman to this necessity , was mightily prompt in his obedience .
Also , he fished a second ham out of the kettle , from which the Englishman cut a great portion , laid it on his own platter , and gave over the remainder to me .
“ There is a marrow-bone to suck , ” said he .
“ ’ Tis the sweetest <unk> , that and a drop of sherris . ” Almost overcome with the pangs of hunger as I was , nothing was further from my intention than to accept a courtesy at these rude hands .
Yet , after all , <unk> has a poor sort of virtue in the presence of a mistress of such <unk> powers .
Before I was aware that I had so much as taken the delicious platter into my keeping , I was conveying sweet smoking morsels into my mouth .
And as the <unk> of so imperious a creature is at all times a delightful exercise , I had scarce felt my teeth in the delectable pig than I forgot my <unk> against the Englishman .
Also I forgot my disgust at the manner of his feeding ; for so choice were these dainty morsels that , after all , I considered it were better not to judge him harshly , as , perhaps , his methods were less unworthy than they seemed .
And he , having dealt faithfully with his second ham , and having called for a pint of sherry in a voice like a trumpet , ere I was half upon my course , proceeded to smile upon my dealings with the marrow-bone in a fashion that can only be described as <unk> .
“ He who stands not true to the trencher is a poor <unk> , ” he said with a most <unk> smile .
“ A brave demeanour at meals is as necessary to the blood , the assemblance and the <unk> of man , as is <unk> , good principles , and contemplation to the soul .
Therefore , eat away , my good little Don Spaniardo , and I pray you to forget that I am present .
If my own poor courage could in anywise compare with yours I should be as near to perfection as is woman to deceit .
<unk> in circumference thou art , fair shrew , but thou art a beautiful <unk> , and a notorious lover of flesh .
How wouldst thou esteem a <unk> , my son , of the brains of a <unk> , as Sir <unk> of my name , and worthy kinsman , always yearned for and so seldom obtained ?
He was a man if you please , and <unk> fine at his meals .
I never heard of a man who was better before a leg of mutton with <unk> <unk> ; and he drank canaries until the very hour they came to measure him for his shell .
How rarely do you find a great nature <unk> to its knife and its nuncheon .
<unk> in the presence of flesh meat is a <unk> to virtue .
But for that I must have been twice the man that I am .
Ha !
my son , give my old pluck such <unk> and I would <unk> my pedigree and be a slave , for a liberal stomach is no friend to displeasure . ” “ Yet , good Englishman , ” said I , with a touch , I fear , of our northern <unk> , “ you seem to do pretty well . ” “ Pretty well ! ” He sighed heavily .
“ Pretty well is pretty well ; pretty well is neither here nor there .
Landlord , bring me this minute a bite of cheese , about so big as the knee of a <unk> ; and further , landlord , another cup of this abominable sherris , or by this hand I will cut your throat , as I am the son of a sainted Christian lady . ” To lend point to this drastic utterance , the Englishman <unk> like a fiend and drew his sword .
This weapon , like everything about him , was of a monstrous character , and he stuck it in the ground beside his stool .
CHAPTER IV OF FURTHER PASSAGES AT THE INN UPON this action , the innkeeper came forward fearfully , for he felt that <unk> threatened .
When he had <unk> the cup of his remarkable guest , I was fain to observe its curious nature .
Its mouth was as wide as a bowl ; and as the body which contained the wine was in a right <unk> to the rim , it had rather the appearance of a <unk> than a cup of sherry .
It was cast in silver , was <unk> chased , while its whole device was quaint and ingenious .
Indeed , I marvelled how one so poor as this innkeeper should have an article of so much worth and beauty in his possession .
After the Englishman had fitted his mouth to the rim for so long a period that he must have come near to looking upon the <unk> , he gave back the cup to the innkeeper , and ordered it to be <unk> .
It was then handed to me , and I was invited to drink .
“ That is if you can , ” said he .
“ It is such a damnable liquor that personally I hardly durst touch it .
But I suspect your stomach is not so proud as mine , you <unk> rogue .
You see , we English are a most delicate people . ” I drank a <unk> <unk> of the wine , which was excellent , or at least my great thirst of the day had made it so .
Then said the Englishman , <unk> me with approval : “ Well , my young companion , and what do you think of the pot ? ” “ The pot is worthy of notice , ” said I , examining its rare contexture .
“ It has been admired in Europe , and it has been admired in Asia , ” said the Englishman .
“ That it merits attention I have been informed by half the great world .
For example , the Emperor Maximilian <unk> a <unk> of <unk> in its homage , and would , I doubt not , have fallen as drunk as a <unk> , had it been possible for a great crowned person to embrace these <unk> courses .
He offered me a thousand guilders for that pot ; but said I , ‘ <unk> Max ’ --I must tell you , Spaniard , there is no crowned person of my acquaintancy for whom I entertain a higher <unk> ‘ honest Max , ’ I said , ‘ offer your old gossip the <unk> <unk> , the sun , the moon , and the most particular stars of heaven , and that pot will still remain faithful to my house . ’ ‘ Why , so , honest Dick ? ’ said the Emperor .
‘ It is in this wise , my old bully <unk> , ’ said I , fetching him a <unk> along the fifth rib with a kindly <unk> , ‘ that pot was given many years ago by the famous Charlemagne to my kinsman , Sir <unk> Pendragon , for his conduct upon the field of battle . ’ ‘ In that case , worthy Richard , friend of my youth and <unk> of my maturity , ’ said the Emperor , embracing me with the greatest affection and <unk> my old sack cup with gold <unk> the <unk> are gold in <unk> ‘ I do not ask it of you ; let it remain an heirloom in your house . ’ Therefore you will see at once , good Spaniard , that this pot is in some sort <unk> .
And in all my travels I bear it at my saddle-bow ; so whether I happen to lie down with fleas in a villainous Spanish venta hard by to <unk> ; or whether I happen to sit at the right hand of potentates in England , <unk> , and France , I can take my sack as I like to take <unk> is , easily and copiously , with a proper freedom for the mouth , and with a <unk> that ’ s wide enough to prevent the nose from tapping against the sides . ” <unk> as I had been from the first in regard to this strange individual , the nature of his conversation rendered me more so .
In spite of his remarkable appearance , his <unk> might once have been that of a person of condition , however lamentably it failed to be so now ; while his manners , although none of those of the great of my own country , may yet have been accustomed to receive consideration from the world .
Therefore I said with a bow , “ Good Sir Englishman , under your worshipful indulgence I would make so bold as to ask your name . ” Such a request seemed to give him great pleasure .
“ That is a very proper question , ” said he , “ for my name <unk> to be one that has been favourably mentioned in every nation of the civilized globe . ” “ Yes , sir , I feel sure of it , ” said I ; for as he spoke his dignity grew of the finest nature .
“ You ask my name , good Spaniard ; well now , what do you think of Richard Pendragon for a name ? ” “ A truly fine name , ” said I , being led to this statement by the love of politeness , although I am not sure that I did not feel it to be a very barbarous name after all .
“ Sir Richard Pendragon , knight ; yes , by my hand , that ’ s a name !
I have seen <unk> and Arabs turn pale at it ; it has been embraced by the foremost in valour ; it has lain in the bed of <unk> .
Yet the bearer of that name is gentle enough , by my soul ; for it is the name of a good and true man , a simple knight , a valiant friend , a courteous enemy ; a <unk> seeker of light who is addicted to reading the stars and the works of nature .
I have seen the wearer of this most inimitable name wipe the blood of a Barbary <unk> off his sword with the <unk> of his <unk> , and sit down and <unk> a <unk> .
I have never seen his superior in female company .
You may well ask my name , good Spaniard , for , without making a boast , which I <unk> , where shall you find such performance <unk> to such simplicity , such chaste austerity to such constancy in love ?
I tell thee , Spaniard , had I not been nurtured in humility , had I not been <unk> to it by my sainted mother , even as the young <unk> is taught to bleat by the reception of its milk , I must have been a <unk> , for I am of royal lineage , and the blood of kings flows under my doublet . ” “ <unk> de <unk> ! ” I cried excitedly , for my own brains seemed overmounted by his enthusiasm , “ you have indeed a great name .
I would love to hear of those kings of whom you appear to be such a worthy descendant . ” “ This is a proper curiosity , my honest youth .
The name of my father is no less than Edward of England .
I am his son , but not his heir .
If every man walked according to his merit , the royal offspring that <unk> you would have the crown of Great Britain <unk> upon his left <unk> at an <unk> of <unk> degrees . ” “ For what reason have you not , sir , if you are indeed the king ’ s son and the crown is yours in the course of nature ? ” “ There was a little <unk> <unk> with my birth , which at the time of its <unk> I was not in a situation to <unk> .
Thenceforward a race of knaves and <unk> have taken the wall of honest Dick , and have placed another upon the throne of England .
But mark me , my son , the hour will strike when one who has grown old in the love of virtue will make good his estate , for he can show a line of kings upon both sides of his family .
Upon the side of his dam is one Uthyr Pendragon , and of the seed of him sprang Arthur , who many years ago was a sovereign lord of Britain .
It was many years ago , I say , but this Arthur was a good prince , a man of integrity , and his name is still mentioned favourably in his native country . ” “ When , sir , do you propose to make this <unk> upon the throne of England ? ” At this question Sir Richard Pendragon assumed an air of magnificence , which did not consort very well with the hole in his scabbard and the condition of his hose and doublet .
“ All in a good season , ” he said majestically .
“ If not <unk> it will be to-morrow .
The truth is the machinations of the wicked have left me somewhat light in purse , and have also <unk> upon my reputation .
But I don ’ t doubt that some fair morning when the <unk> are singing , the first-born son of a sainted mother , for all his misfortune and his plaguy dry throat , will land at <unk> and <unk> to London city at the head of twenty thousand Christian gentlemen who have sworn to redress his <unk> . ” “ May I be one of so fair a company ! ” said I , feeling the spell of his passion .
“ <unk> to that , honest youth . ” He spoke <unk> .
“ Give old honest Dickon your hand upon it .
There is no sort of doubt that I shall hold you to a <unk> that does such honour to your nation and your character .
By the way , is that a ring I see upon your finger , honest youth ? ” “ It is an heirloom of my house , ” said I.
“ It was given by my father to my mother when he came to woo her . ” The Englishman raised his <unk> with an aspect of grave interest .
“ Was that so , my young companion ?
<unk> by your father to your <unk> that really the case ?
And set with agates , unless my eyes deceive me . ” “ Yes , they are agates . ” “ The sight of agates puts me in mind of a ring I had of my old friend , the Sophy .
I used always to affect it on the middle finger of the right hand , just as you affect your own , my son , until it was <unk> by my sainted mother upon a wet <unk> Wednesday . ” Still <unk> the tokens of a lively regard , the Englishman began to fondle the ring as it lay on my finger .
“ An honest band of gold , of a very chaste device .
It looks uncommonly choice on the hand of a gentleman .
Does it not fit somewhat <unk> , my young companion ? ” Speaking thus , and before I could suspect his intention , Sir Richard Pendragon drew the ring off my finger .
He held it up to the light , and proceeded to examine it with the <unk> <unk> .
“ I observe it was made in <unk> , ” said he .
“ It must have lain for years in a nobleman ’ s family .
My own was fashioned in <unk> , but I would say this is almost as choice as the gift of the Sophy .
And as I say , my son , it certainly makes an uncommonly fine appearance on the hand of a gentleman . ” Thereupon Sir Richard Pendragon pressed the slender band of <unk> upon the large fat middle finger of his right hand .
“ It comes on by no means so easy as the Sophy ’ s gift , ” said he ; “ but then , to be sure , my old gossip had a true circumference taken by the court jeweller .
I often think of that court jeweller , such an odd , <unk> little fellow as ’ a was .
’ A had a cast in the right eye , and I remember that when he walked one leg went shorter than its neighbour .
But for all that ’ a knew what an <unk> was , and his face was as open as a fine evening in June . ” With an air of pleasantry that was impossible to resist , Sir Richard passed his cup and <unk> me to drain it .
I drank a little of the wine , yet with some uneasiness , for it was sore to me that my father ’ s talisman was upon the hand of a stranger .
“ I shall thank you , sir , to <unk> the ring to my care . ” “ With all the pleasure in life , my son . ” The Englishman took hold of his finger and gave it a mighty pull , but the ring did not yield .
He shook his head and began to <unk> <unk> .
“ Why , as I am a good Christian man this plaguy ring sticks to my hand like a <unk> <unk> to a warm <unk> .
<unk> it , my son , I pray you . ” I also took a pull at the ring , which was <unk> so firmly upon his hand , but it would not <unk> .
“ This is indeed a terrible matter , ” said Sir Richard Pendragon .
“ What is to be done , young Spaniard ? ” He called the innkeeper and bade him bring a bowl of cold water .
<unk> this he dipped his finger ; and although he held it in the water for quite a long time , the ring and his right hand could not be <unk> to part company .
“ What is the price you set upon this ring , my young companion ? ” “ The ring is beyond <unk> was my mother ’ <unk> has ever been in the keeping of an ancient house . ” “ If it is beyond price there is an end to the question .
I was about to offer you money , but I see you have one of those lofty spirits that can brook no vulgar <unk> .
