Well , well , pride of birth is a good thing , and money is but little .
Yet one who has grown old in the love of virtue would like to requite you in some way .
Had we not better throw a main with the dice ?
If I win I wear the ring for my lawful use ; and if I lose you shall have the good tuck that was given to me by the King of <unk> for helping him against the Dutch . ” I did not accept this suggestion , as you may believe .
Yet it gave me sore concern to see my father ’ s heirloom upon the hand of this foreigner .
In what fashion it was to be lured from his finger I was at a loss to know ; and in my <unk> of the world I did not know what course to embrace .
CHAPTER <unk> I HEAR OF THE PRINCESS UPON his own part Sir Richard Pendragon showed a wonderful calmness .
He wore the ring upon his finger with so great an air , and withal was so polite that the <unk> of a quarrel was put out of the question .
None the less it was clear that if ever I was to recover my father ’ s gift it must be at the point of the sword .
It is always claimed , however , by the <unk> of my province , which in the things of the mind is allowed to be the first in all Spain , that a cool judgment must ride before violence .
Therefore I was in no haste to push the matter to an extremity .
My mind was set that I could only regain possession of the <unk> by an <unk> to the sword ; that soon or late we must submit ourselves to that <unk> , but as the night was yet in its youth , I felt there was no need to force the brawl before its season .
Thus , <unk> my injury in secret I marked the man <unk> as he sat his stool , with his hungry eyes forever trained upon me sideways , and forever glancing down with furtive laughter , while his great lean limbs in their patched , <unk> hose , in which the weather had wrought various hues , were sprawled out towards the warmth of the chimney .
As thus he lay it was hard to decide whether he was indeed a king ’ s son or no more than a <unk> adventurer .
And in spite of the flattering opinions he put forward of his own character , I was fain to come to it that the latter conclusion was at least very near to the truth .
For one thing , the lack of <unk> in his demeanour did not consort very well with the descendant of princes , whom all the world knows to be grave men .
He never so much as looked towards me without a secret light of mirth in his eye ; and this I was unable to account for , as for myself I had never felt so grave .
“ Sir Richard Pendragon , knight , ” said he , for no particular reason , unless it were the love of hearing his own discourse ; “ of all names I believe that to be the most delectable ; for it is the name of a true man , of one addicted to contemplation , and of one who has grown old in the love of virtue .
Sir Richard Pendragon , <unk> name is a small thing , but it has its natural music ; Sir Richard Pendragon , <unk> , it <unk> off the tongue to a tune .
I think , my young companion , you have already admired it ? ” “ Indeed , sir , I have , ” said I , with a certain measure of mockery , of which , upon occasion , those of my province are said to be <unk> in the use .
“ I conceive it to be a most wonderful name .
Have you not said so yourself ? ” “ If I have , I have , ” said he , <unk> my shoulder with a familiarity for which I did not thank him .
“ After all , the murder was obliged to come out .
Is it the part of valour to <unk> the truth ?
My young companion , I feel sure you are one of those who respect that <unk> opinion that is shared by <unk> <unk> <unk> and other learned <unk> upon the subject .
Indeed , it is very well that a name which stands so high in middle Europe is come into this outer part .
<unk> recently I feared it to be otherwise .
I met an <unk> priest , not a month ago , bald , <unk> , and <unk> , who said that to his mind my name was deficient .
‘ Fair sir , for what is it celebrated ? ’ was his question .
‘ For what is it celebrated , reverend one ? ’ was my rejoinder .
‘ Why , where can you have lived these virtuous years of yours ?
It is the name of a notorious <unk> and <unk> . ’ ‘ That is verily a singular accomplishment , ’ said the reverend father in God .
‘ Yes , your reverence , ’ I answered , ‘ this old honest fellow can draw a <unk> through a straw with the same complacency as a good churchman can draw sack through the neck of a bottle . ’ ‘ That is indeed remarkable , ’ said the reverend father , and proceeded to <unk> that as <unk> were wide and straws were narrow , it was no light matter .
‘ Yes , my father , ’ said I , ‘ that is a very just observation .
But I am sure you would be the last to believe that one who has a king ’ s blood flowing under his doublet would bring his mind to anything trivial . ’ ‘ Doubtless your view is the correct one , ’ said the reverend <unk> , ‘ but all the same , I fail to see how a king ’ s blood would be able to compass a <unk> of that nature . ’ ‘ There is none shall say what a king ’ s blood will compass , ’ was my final rejoinder , ‘ for there is a particular genius in it . ’ Yet , my young son of the Spains , I have little doubt that the worthy <unk> is still breaking his mind upon this problem behind the walls of Mother Church ; and such is the subtlety of these scholars with their <unk> rules and their <unk> , that presently you shall find that this innocent pleasantry has unhinged the brains of half the <unk> in Salamanca . ” “ You have indeed a ready wit and a subtle contrivance , sir , ” said I at the conclusion of this ridiculous tale , for it was plain that he looked for some such <unk> upon it .
“ You must blame my nation for that .
Every Englishman is <unk> when he has taken wine ; he is an especially bright dog in everything after the drinking of <unk> .
You dull rogues of the continent can form no conception of an Englishman ’ s humour . ” “ How comes it , sir , that you find yourself an <unk> from this land which , by your account of it , is fair <unk> ? ” “ It is a matter of fortune , ” he made answer .
“ Is that to say you are on a quest of fortune ? ” said I , breathing high at this magic word .
“ You have come to the truth , ” said he with a sigh and a smile and a sidelong look at the sword that hung by his leg .
“ Why then , sir , ” I cried with an eagerness I could not restrain , “ we are as brothers in this matter .
I also am on a quest of fortune . ” My words seemed to <unk> with the humour of Sir Richard Pendragon .
He looked at me long and curiously , with that side glance which I did not find altogether agreeable , stroked his beard as if <unk> in deep thought , and said with the gravest air I had heard him use , “ Oh , indeed , my son , is that the case !
So you are on a quest of fortune , are you , my son ?
Well , she is a nice , a proper , and a valiant word . ” “ My father was ever the first to allow it , ” said I.
“ She used him ill ; his right hand was struck off in a battle at a tender age , but I never heard him complain about her . ” “ She hath ever been haughty and distant with old English Dick , ” said my companion , sighing heavily ; “ but you will never hear that true mettle abuse the proud jade .
Fortune , ” he repeated and I saw his great hungry eyes begin to kindle until they shone like <unk> “ oh , what a name is that !
She is <unk> in the ears of us of England than is the <unk> .
What have we not adventured in thy name , thou perfect one !
Here is this Dick , this old red bully , with his dry throat and his sharp ears and his readily <unk> eye , what hath he not dared for thee , thou dear ungracious one !
He has borne his point in every land , from the wall of <unk> to the high <unk> mountains ; from the blessed <unk> of Britain to <unk> Arabia .
Who was it drove the <unk> out of <unk> with a <unk> pole ?
Who was it beat the Preux Chevalier off his ground with a short sword ?
Who was it <unk> the <unk> of the Moriscoes with his own incomparable hand ?
Who was it , and wherefore was it , my son ? ” In this exaltation of his temper he peered at me with his side glance , as though he would seek an answer to a question to which no answer was necessary .
“ Why do I handle , ” he proceeded , “ the sword , the broadsword , the short sword , the sword and buckler , and above all that <unk> invention of God , the nimble rapier of Ferrara steel , with the nice mastery of an old honest blade , but in thy service , thou sweet <unk> with thy moist lip and thy <unk> eye ? ” “ Ah !
Sir Englishman , ” cried I , feeling , in spite of his rough brogue , the music of his nature , “ I love to hear you speak thus . ” “ Thirty years have I been at the trade , good Spaniard , and sooner than change it I would die .
One hundred towns have I <unk> ; ten fortunes have I <unk> .
But by sack they came , and by sack they did <unk> .
It is wonderful how a great nature has a love of sack .
Yet I have but my nose to show for my passion .
Do you observe its prominent hue , which by night is so luminous that it <unk> like a beacon to <unk> the honest <unk> ?
Yet to Fortune will we wet our beards , good Spaniard , for we of England court her like a <unk> with a <unk> in her cheek . ” Having concluded this <unk> , Sir Richard Pendragon called the landlord in a tone like thunder , bade him bring a cup of sherry for my use , and fill up his own , which was passing empty .
“ I will bear the charges , <unk> one , ” said Sir Richard with great magnificence .
“ Oh yes , your worship ” --the poor innkeeper was as pale as a <unk> “ but there is already such a score against your <unk> ” “ Score , you knave ! ” Sir Richard rolled his eyes horribly .
“ Why , if I were not so gentle as a woman I would cut your throat .
Score , you dog !
Then have you no true sense of delicacy ?
Now I would ask you , you <unk> ruffian with your <unk> eyes and your soft chaps , are gentlemen when they sit <unk> their <unk> in their own private tavern , are they to be crossed in their <unk> by the lowest order of man ?
<unk> me two <unk> of sack this minute , or by this hand I will cut a <unk> in your neck . ” The unlucky wight had fled ere his guest had got half through this speech , which even in my ears was <unk> , with such roars of fury was it given .
When he returned with two more cups filled with wine , Sir Richard looked towards me and laid his finger to the side of his nose , as though to suggest that he yielded to no man in the handling of an innkeeper .
By the time he had drunk this excellent liquor there came a sensible change in the Englishman ’ s mien .
The poetry of his mood , which had led him to speak of Fortune in terms to kindle the soul , yielded to one more fit for common affairs .
“ Having lain in my castle , ” said he , “ and being well nourished with sack , to-morrow I start on my travels again .
Upon <unk> I would not mind taking a young squire . ” He <unk> me with a look of a very searching character .
“ I say , ” he repeated solemnly , stretching out his enormous legs , “ I am minded to take a young squire . ” “ In what , sir , would his duties consist ? ” “ They would be mild , good Don .
<unk> that this young <unk> he were a man of birth so much the <unk> me a hundred crowns a year , <unk> my horse of a morning and conversed with me pleasantly in the afternoon , I would undertake to teach him the world . ” “ Why , sir , ” said I , “ surely it would be more fitting if your squire received one hundred crowns from you <unk> , which might stand as his emolument . ” “ Emolument ! ” said the Englishman , stroking his beard .
“ One hundred crowns !
These be very quaint ideas . ” “ Why , sir , ” said I , with something of that <unk> for which our province is famous , “ would not your squire have duties to perform , and would they not be worthy of <unk> ? ” “ <unk> ! <unk> ! ” said the Englishman , stroking his beard furiously .
“ Why , can you not know , good Don , I am in the habit of receiving a thousand guilders <unk> <unk> for <unk> the world to <unk> of the nobility ? ” “ Indeed , sir !
can a knowledge of the world be of so much worth ? ” The Englishman roared at that which he took for my simplicity .
“ By my soul ! ” he exclaimed , “ a knowledge of the world is a most desperate science .
I have met many learned men in my travels , but that science always beat them .
Cæsar was a learned man , but he would have had <unk> holes in his doublet had he gone to school earlier .
It is a deep science , my son ; it is the deepest science of all .
What do you know of deceit , my son , you who have never left your native mountains before this morning ?
You , with the dust of your rustic province upon your boots , what do you know of those who hold you in fair speaking that they may know the better where to put the knife ? ” “ I confess , sir , I have thought but little of these things , ” I said humbly , for my misadventure with the beggar woman was still in my mind , and my mother ’ s ring was no longer in the keeping of her only son .
“ Then you will do well to think upon it , my young companion , ” said the Englishman , regarding me with his great red eyes .
“ You talk of fortune , Spaniard , you who have yet to move ten leagues into the world !
Why , this is <unk> madness .
You who have not even heard of the famous city of London and the great English nation , might easily fall in with a robber , or be most <unk> cheated in a civil affair .
Why , you who say ‘ if you please ’ to an innkeeper might easily lose your purse . ” “ I may be ill found in knowledge , sir , but I hope my sword is worthy , ” said I , determined that none should contemn my valour , even if my poor mind was to be <unk> at .
“ Oh , so you hope your sword is worthy , do you now ? ” The Englishman <unk> furiously as if moved by a <unk> .
“ Well , Master <unk> , that is a good accomplishment to carry , and I suspect that you may find it so one of these nights when there is no moon . ” All the same Sir Richard Pendragon continued to laugh in his dry manner , and fell again to looking at me sideways .
For my life I could not see where was the occasion for so much levity .
“ My father has taught me the use of the sword , ” said I.
“ Oh , so your father has taught you the use of the sword !
Well , to judge by the length of your beard , good Don , I am inclined to suspect that your father had a worthy <unk> . ” “ I hope I may say so . ” “ Oh , so you hope you may say so , my son !
Well , now , I think you may take it , good Don , from one who has grown old in the love of virtue , that your father would know as much of the sword as a burgomaster knows of <unk> .
You see , having had his right hand struck off in battle at a tender age , unless he happened to be a most infernally <unk> fellow he <unk> his only means of becoming a learned <unk> . ” The Englishman laughed in his belly .
“ My father had excellent precept , ” said I , “ although , as you say , the Hand of God curtailed his practice . ” “ Well now , my son , ” said Sir Richard Pendragon , <unk> a grave air , which yet did not appear a very sincere one , “ he who speaks you is one whose practice the Hand of God has not curtailed .
He was <unk> with sword and basket in his <unk> infancy .
He has played with all the first <unk> in Europe ; he has made it a life study .
With all the true principles of this inimitable art he is familiar .
He has been <unk> upon his talent and genius , natural and acquired , by those whom modesty forbids him to name .
And all these <unk> , my worthy Don , of experience , ensample , and good wit are at your command for the ridiculous sum of an hundred crowns . ” “ I have not an hundred crowns in the world , sir , ” I confessed with reluctancy , for his arguments were masterful .
“ By cock ! ” he snarled , “ that is just as I suspected . ” There could be no mistaking the change in his demeanour when I made this unhappy confession .
It caused him to resolve his gross and rough features into some form of contemplation .
At last he said , with an eye that was like a <unk> ’ s , -- “ What is the sum in your poke , good Spaniard ? ” “ I have but eight crowns . ” “ <unk> crowns !
Why , to hear your conversation one would think you owned a province . ” “ A good sword , a devout heart , and the precepts of my noble father must serve , sir , as my kingdom , ” said I , hurt not a little at the remarkable change that had come over him .
“ I myself , ” said he , “ have always been <unk> and <unk> of that kingdom , and had it not been for a love of canaries in my youth , which in my middle years has yielded to a love of sherris , I must have administered it well .
But there is also this essential <unk> in our conditions , my son .
I am one of bone and <unk> , an Englishman , therefore one of <unk> ’ s first works ; whereas you , good Don , saving your worshipful presence , are but a <unk> and <unk> fellow , as thick in the brains as a heifer , and as yellow in the complexion as a <unk> under his belly .
Your mind has been so <unk> by provincial ideas , and your stature so wizened by the sun , that to a liberal <unk> they seem nowise superior to a maggot in a <unk> , or a <unk> fly in the window of a village <unk> . ” “ Sir Englishman , ” said I haughtily , for since I had told him I had but eight crowns in the world his manner of speaking had grown intolerable , “ I do not doubt that among your own nation you are a person of merit , but it would not come amiss if you understood that you pay your addresses to a hidalgo of Spain .
And I must crave leave to assure you that in his eyes one of your nation is but little superior to a <unk> Arab who is as black as a coal .
At least , I have always understood my father , God keep him !
to say this . ” “ By my faith , then , ” said the Englishman , “ even for a Spaniard your father must have been very ill informed . ” “ Sir Richard Pendragon , ” said I sternly , “ I would have you be wary of the manner in which you mention my father . ” “ I pray you , brother , do not make me laugh . ” He trained his sidelong look upon me .
“ I have such an immoderately nimble <unk> has ever been the curse of my family from mother to daughter , from father to <unk> doth cause the blood to commit all manner of <unk> upon mine old head veins .
All my ancestors died of a fluxion that did not die of steel .
But I tell you , Spaniard , it is as plain as my hand that your father must have been a <unk> fellow to beget such a poor son . ” “ Sir Richard Pendragon , ” I cried , incensed beyond <unk> , “ if you abuse my father I will run you through the heart ! ” “ Well , ” said he , “ this is good speaking on eight crowns , a provincial accent , and a piece of <unk> iron which is fitter to <unk> half a saddle of mutton than to enhance the scabbard of a gentleman .
And if you make this speaking good , why , it will be still better .
For this is a very high <unk> , brother , you are setting up , and I doubt me grievously whether even the Preux Chevalier would be able to <unk> it . ” He concluded with such an insolent and unexpected roar of laughter as made me grow furious .
“ I would have you <unk> , sir ! ” I cried .
“ Were you twice as gross in your stature and three times as rude , I run you through the heart if again you contemn the <unk> name of my noble father . ” “ Your father was <unk> , ” said this gigantical ruffian , looking at me <unk> .
“ He was as stupid in his wits as a Spanish mule , and I spit in the face of the <unk> child that bears his name . ” CHAPTER VI OF A PRIVATE BRAWL .
I TAKE PROFIT AT THE COST OF REPUTATION BEFORE I could draw my sword my <unk> was on his feet , had <unk> away the stool on which he had sat , and had <unk> his own weapon .
I was so overcome with fury that I could not stay to mark his enormous stature , yet his head seemed to live among the hams in the roof .
This was the first occasion I had drawn my sword in a quarrel , but I needed to ask no better .
The pure reputation of this noble heart I was defending <unk> my right arm with <unk> strength .
Besides , I was <unk> years old , well grown and nourished for one of my nation .
My blade was of an ancient pattern , but a true Toledo of the first quality , and many high deeds of the field had been wrought thereby .
The Englishman towered above me in the extremity of his stature , but had he been of twice that assemblance , in my present mood I would not have feared him .
For , as I was fain to believe , some of the <unk> fighting blood of our northern provinces was in my veins .
This was my first duello ; but you must not forget , reader , that my father had instructed me how to bear my point , how to thrust , how to receive , and , above all , how to conduct the wrist as laid down by the foremost practice .
We spent little time in <unk> , for my anger would not permit them .
At once I ran in upon my adversary , thrusting straight at his heart .
Yet he received my sword on his own with a skill that was truly wonderful , and turned it aside with ease .
All the power I possessed was behind it , yet he cast it off almost as complacently as if he had been <unk> away a <unk> .
The sting of this failure and his air of disdain caused me to spring at him like a cat , yet , I grieve to say , without its wariness , for , do what I would , I was unable to come near him .
He saved every stroke with a most <unk> blade , not once moving his wrist or <unk> his <unk> .
After this action had proceeded for some minutes I was compelled to draw off to fetch my breath ; whereon said my adversary with a <unk> of contempt that hurt me more than my <unk> : -- “ I wish , my son , you would help me to pass the time of the day . ” My instant <unk> was a most furious <unk> at his head , although it is proper to mention that this method was not recommended in the rules of the art as expounded by the illustrious Don Ygnacio .
But I grieve to confess that rage had <unk> me .
Yet Sir Richard Pendragon evaded this blow as <unk> as he had evaded the others .
“ Come , brother , ” he said ; “ even for a Spaniard this is <unk> .
This is no more than knife work .
I am persuaded your father was a <unk> , and owed his entire practice to the <unk> of the <unk> hog . ” Such derision galled me worse than a thrust from his sword .
<unk> away all discretion I ran in upon him <unk> , for at that moment I was minded to make an end one way or another .
“ Worse and worse , ” said he .
“ You bear your blade like a <unk> ’ s daughter .
Still , do not despair , my young companion ; perhaps you will make better practice for my left hand . ” As he spoke , to my dismay he changed his weapon from his right hand to his left , and parried me with the same <unk> dexterity .
Suddenly he made a strong <unk> , and in the next instant I felt the point of his sword at my breast .
“ Your father must have been a strangely ignorant man , even for a Spaniard , ” he said .
“ I do not wonder that he lost his right hand at an early age .
You have as little defence as a notorious <unk> on his trial .
Any time these five minutes you must have been slain . ” Then it was I closed my eyes in the extremity of shame and never expected to open them again .
But to my astonishment the forces of nature continued to <unk> , and soon , in a vertigo of fear and anger , I was fain to look for the cause .
It seemed that my enemy had lowered his point and drawn off .
<unk> he <unk> to use me as a cat uses a mouse , for his private pleasure .
For that reason I fell the harder upon him , since I knew my life to be forfeit , and I had an instinct that the more furiously it was yielded the less should I know of a horrid end .
“ I will now <unk> your doublet , my son , ” said Sir Richard Pendragon .
“ Have you a favourite rib you would care to select ?
What of the fifth ? ” Without more ado he began cutting my doublet with a dexterity that was amazing .
His point flashed here and there across my breast and seemed to touch it in a thousand places ; yet , although the old leather was <unk> continually , no hap was suffered by my skin .
“ If only I had my lighter and more <unk> blade of Ferrara here , ” he said in the midst of a thousand <unk> and <unk> , “ I would <unk> every <unk> off your doublet so <unk> as a <unk> . ” “ <unk> me ! ” I cried , flinging myself upon his blade .
I made such a terrific <unk> with my sword that it whistled through the air , and was like to cut off his head .
Instead , however , of <unk> it to do so , he met it with a curious turn of the wrist , and the weapon was hurled from my grasp .
As I stood before him <unk> and dishevelled , and young in the veins and full in them too , I seemed to care no more than a <unk> of snow for what was about to occur .
I could but feel that I had <unk> my father ’ s reputation , and had cast a grievous <unk> upon his precept .
The blood was <unk> my eyes and singing in my ears , but quite strangely I was not <unk> the blade of my enemy .
That which was <unk> in my mind was the landlord ’ s opinion that he was the Devil in <unk> .
Upon striking my sword to the ground he bade me remark his method of <unk> .
“ It <unk> perfection so nearly , ” said he , “ as aught can that is the offspring of the <unk> of man .
It is the fruit of a virtuous maturity ; it is the crown of artifice ; consider all the rest as nought .
For I do tell thee , Spaniard , this piece of <unk> , as they say at Paris , <unk> one of God ’ s own good swordsmen from the vulgar <unk> of <unk> or the commonalty .
And , mark you , it was all done with the left hand . ” While awaiting with as much composure as I could summon that stroke which was to put me out of life , there happened a strange thing .
There had come into the room , <unk> by us both , the <unk> to the inn .
And in a moment , seeing what was toward , this brave little creature , not much bigger than a stool , and as handsome and flashing a quean as ever I saw , ran between me and the sword of my adversary .
“ <unk> , you bloody foreign man ! ” she cried imperiously .
“ Nay , hold yourself , you neat imp , ” said the Englishman , catching her round the middle by his right arm , and lightly <unk> her a dozen paces as though she had been a sack of feathers .
Yet he had made but a poor reckoning if he thought he could thus <unk> of this fearless thing .
For his wine cup , half full of sherry , which had been set in the chimney-place out of the way of hap , was to her hand .
She picked it up , and hurled the pot and its contents full in the face of the giant .
“ Take it , you wicked piece of <unk> ! ” she cried .
Now , by a singular mischance the edge of the cup struck Sir Richard Pendragon on the forehead .
It caused a wound so deep that his blood was mingled with the excellent wine .
Together they flowed into his eyes and down his cheeks , and so <unk> that they stained his doublet and <unk> upon the floor .
And the <unk> girl , seeing my enemy ’ s discomfiture , for what with the liquor and what with his <unk> he was almost blind for the <unk> , she darted across the room and picked up my sword .
With a most valiant eagerness she pressed it into my hand .
“ Now , young señor gentleman , quick , quick ! ” she cried .
“ Have at him and make an end of him ! ” “ Alack , you good soul , ” said I , “ this cannot be .
I am the lawful prize of my adversary .
God go with you , you kind thing . ” I cast the sword to the ground .
“ Then oh , young master , you are a very fool . ” Tears sprang to the eyes of the honest girl and <unk> her fiery glances .
However , so <unk> was the creature in my cause that she picked up my sword again , and crying , “ I myself will do it , señor , ” actually had at the English barbarian with the greatest imaginable valiancy .
In the meantime the giant had been <unk> at his own predicament in the most immoderate fashion .
For , on feeling his head , and <unk> that the stream that <unk> into his eyes was a <unk> of <unk> so delectable , he cast forth his tongue at it in a highly whimsical manner , and drew as much into his mouth as he could obtain .
“ I have my errors , ” he cried , <unk> with mirth ; “ but if a wanton disregard of God ’ s honest sherris be there among , when he <unk> may this ruby-coloured one be called to the land of the <unk> <unk> .
Jesu !
what a body this Pendragon azure gives it .
’ Tis choicer than <unk> out of the <unk> of a Mohammedan .
When the hour comes to invest me in my shell , I will get me a <unk> of sherris and <unk> a main <unk> , and I will perish by mine own <unk> . ” He had scarcely concluded these <unk> when the brave little maid had at him with my sword .
<unk> no such <unk> on the part of one not much <unk> than his leg , it needed all his adroitness of foot , which for one of his stature was indeed surprising , to save the steel from his ribs .
And so set was the creature on making an end of him that the force with which she <unk> at his huge form , and yet <unk> it , carried her completely beyond her <unk> .
With another of his mighty roars , the English giant seized her by the <unk> with his right hand , and held her up in the air by the <unk> , so curiously as if she had been a fierce little cat that had flown at him .
“ Why , thou small spitfire , ” he said , “ thou art even too slight to be <unk> under mine heel .
Thou pretty devil , I will buss thee . ” “ I will bite off the end of your nose , you bloody-minded villain , ” cried the little wench , <unk> <unk> in his gripe .
“ Nay , why this enmity , pretty titmouse , ” said the giant , “ seeing that I have a mind to fondle thee for thy valour ? ” “ You would slay the young gentleman señor , you wicked cut-throat villain , you ! ” “ Nay , by my hand I will not , if you will give me twenty honest busses , you neat imp , to heal my <unk> . ” “ You swear , Englishman , upon your wicked beard , the young señor gentleman shall come to no hurt if I kiss you ? ” “ I will swear , thou nice <unk> , by the bones of all my ancestors in their Cornish <unk> , that young Don <unk> shall go <unk> for all his sauciness and pretension .
With eight crowns in his wallet and a most <unk> ignorance he drew his tuck on a right Pendragon .
But so much effrontery shall go unvisited , mark you , at the price of twenty honest busses from those perfect lips of thine .
If thou art not the most perfect thing in Spain , I am little better than a swaggerer . ” “ Put me down then , Englishman , ” said the little wench as boldly as an ambassador ; “ and do you give the young gentleman señor his sword . ” “ So I will ; but I would have you remark it , pretty titmouse , that I will be embraced with all the valiancy of thy nature .
Ten on each side of my royal chaps , and one for good kindness right i ’ th ’ middle . ” “ Give the young gentleman señor his sword , then , you English villain . ” So had this matter accosted the humour of Sir Richard Pendragon that he obeyed her .
“ Take it , young Spaniard , ” said he with a magnificent air ; “ and do you consider it as your first lesson in the affairs of the world .
I do perceive two precepts to whose attention your noble father does not appear to have directed you .
The first is , never draw upon the <unk> swordsman of his age , so long as life hath any savour in it ; and for the other , never lack the favour of a <unk> .
Do I speak sooth , good girl ? ” “ Yes , you do , you large villain , ” said the little creature , with her two fierce eyes as black as <unk> .
“ And now I will kiss you quickly , so that I may have done .
I shall scarcely be able to <unk> so much as a piece of soft cheese for a month after it . ” The Englishman seated himself upon his stool , and set her upon his knees .
“ <unk> upon the right , my pretty she , slowly , <unk> , and with valiancy .
I would as <unk> have your lips as a bombard of sherris .
If it were not for one Betty Tucker , a dainty piece at the ‘ Knight in Armour ’ public-house hard by to the town of Barnet , in the kingdom of Great Britain , I would bear you at my saddle-bow all the way back to our little England , and marry you at the church of <unk> Clement the <unk> , which is in London city .
For next to sack I love valour , and next to valour I love my soul .
Now then , thou nice miniard , I must taste thy lips softly , courteously , but yet with valiancy as becomes thy disposition . ” It was never my fortune to behold a sight more whimsical than that of this monstrous fellow seated with the blood still <unk> down to his chin , while this little black-eyed wench , not much bigger than his fist , with her skin the colour of a <unk> , her hair hanging loose , and her rough clothes stained and in tatters , dealt out her kisses first to one side of his <unk> mouth and then to the other , yet making as she did so lively gestures of disgust .
“ Courteously , courteously ! ” cried the giant .
“ Let us have no unmannerly haste in this operation , or I will have them all over again . ” “ Nay , you shall not ; I will take heed of that .
That is <unk> .
<unk> ten , you foreign villain , would give me a <unk> in my front teeth . ” “ Nay , that is but <unk> , my pretty mouse .
Here we have the <unk> .
Courteously , courteously , do I not tell thee .
See to it that it is so long drawn out that I may count nine . ” “ There ’ s twenty , you large villain ! ” cried the little creature in huge disgust , and <unk> off his knee as quickly as a <unk> .
“ Aye , but where ’ s the lucky one , the one right i ’ th ’ middle , that I was to have for good fellowship ? ” “ It was not in the terms , and I will not give it thee . ” “ Not in the terms , pretty titmouse !
By my hand I will not be cozened in this manner . ” The little creature <unk> away like a <unk> , but the giant had his hands on her before she could get to the door .
“ Now for the lucky one , thou sweet <unk> , the one right i ’ th ’ middle , ” cried he , <unk> her up to him as though she had been a squirrel .
“ <unk> me , foreign dog ! ” she cried , with a <unk> of defiance , “ else I will bite thee in the cheek . ” “ Do thou , sweet <unk> , for I love thee . ” “ There , you large villain ! ” She darted her strong teeth , flashing with <unk> , at him , and he dropped her with an oath , as though she had been a snake .
She made off out of doors as <unk> as a cat , leaving the astonished giant to staunch yet another wound she had dealt him .
“ By my soul ” --he pressed his hands to his ribs and his face grew empurpled with his <unk> “ I have the greatest mind in the world to marry that pretty doxey . ” CHAPTER VII OF THE DISABILITIES THAT ATTEND ON GENTLE BIRTH “ SIR RICHARD PENDRAGON , ” said I , when at last the immoderation of his mirth would permit me to address him , “ I make you my service .
I owe it to your clemency that I retain my life . ” “ My young companion , ” said he , “ I pray you not to mention so small an affair .
I did but require a little exercise for mine arm .
I had no mind whatever to slay you . ” “ I am afraid , Sir Richard , ” I confessed , “ that in my heat I would have slain you readily had it but lain in my power . ” “ Well , well , ” said this remarkable man , with a <unk> for which I should have been the last to allow him the credit , “ in our heats and violences even we strong minds are like to commit that from which in <unk> we should refrain .
I remember <unk> upon this point with the Crown Prince of <unk> .
‘ Charles , ’ said <unk> was ever a great familiarity between <unk> ‘ Charles , ’ said I , ‘ I would slay no man in a private quarrel unless he were a villain . ’ ‘ Not even if he had sworn to slay you , my illustrious friend ? ’ said the Crown Prince .
‘ No , Charles , ’ said I.
‘ The truly illustrious are the truly magnanimous . ’ ‘ The sentiment is fine , good coz , ’ said the heir to the throne .
‘ There speaks a great folly or a great nature . ’ Now , my young companion , which cap is it that <unk> the first-born son of a sainted English lady ? ” “ I believe you to be a good man , Sir Englishman .
I know you are a great swordsman ; and also you appear to have an excellent knowledge of the world .
I make you my service . ” “ These are honest words , ” said he .
“ I wish you had an hundred crowns ; you would make a good appearance as my squire .
You would be able to <unk> my horse as well as another , and <unk> my spurs , and in return I would advise you in the use of the sword , the broadsword , and , above all , the noblest of God ’ s <unk> Italian rapier . ” “ I would that I had , sir , for it would seem that I have but slight pretension to the handling of these weapons .
And <unk> that here is an art in which a man must <unk> to <unk> if he is to win his way to fortune in a time so perilous . ” “ You speak sooth , my son .
A pedigree will bring no advancement to virtue in these evil times unless it is accompanied by a bit of shrewd steel and a <unk> wrist to push home its modest claims .
But I grieve to say , good Don , that I never met a more <unk> blade .
Had you never borne it before in the cause of integrity ? ” I confessed that I had not .
“ Well , gossip , you must pass many a weary <unk> ere you can win the mastery of this incomparable <unk> .
But in spite of your nation , as I perceive you to be a youth of parts , I have a mind to put you in the way of the rudiments .
My young son of the Spains , your peninsula is a foolish one ; but , as I say , you are of good birth and your <unk> are <unk> <unk> particulars upon which my sainted mother was extremely nice .
It will only be a little against me if I teach you the use of the sword .
Give me those eight crowns and you shall be my squire . ” He held out his hand for all I had in the world .
Yet this was a matter for grave reflection .
Poor as I was , and <unk> in my thoughts , I was still a Spanish gentleman ; and <unk> as was this Englishman with the sword , and finely as he was found in wisdom , he was yet one of another nation , and scarcely to be <unk> by a blood like mine .
My condition was such that I could not give my service to one less in degree than a Spanish nobleman , or one who was at least a prince in his own country ; and although this Englishman had moved about the courts of Europe and Asia Minor , and the blood of kings flowed under his doublet , it was yet a <unk> thing for my father ’ s son , a veritable Sarda y Boegas , to attend him in a humble capacity .
“ Why , brother , ” said Sir Richard Pendragon , “ would you insult a <unk> nature with your reluctancy ?
Is not the suggestion a noble one ?
Is it not princely ?
Have I not <unk> a great mind about Europe for thirty years in the mild pursuit of knowledge , and do I not place at your service the whole store of my politeness for the paltry sum of eight crowns ?
Yet was I ever immoderate in the love of worth .
My young Spaniard , I have conceived a deep regard for your character .
Besides , I am in need of a squire , and between you and me and the door , eight crowns will not come amiss . ” So much fair and honourable speaking upon the part of the Englishman caused me to take most earnest thought .
But at last , with a proper <unk> , for the offer was fine from a swordsman so notable , I felt I must deny him .
“ I thank you from the heart , sir , for such fair words , proceeding as they do from a man of learning and genius , but I fear I must seek my fortune alone .
My condition renders it necessary that the person I serve be not less in degree than one of the Spanish nobility . ” “ By cock ! ” he cried , “ is not a Pendragon worthy ?
Can you be unacquainted with the fact that a king ’ s blood flows under every doublet of that name ? ” “ It is not the blood of a king of Spain , and therefore , good Englishman , though I like you well , I fear I cannot attend you . ” I think my words must have worked on this mad <unk> I have come to know the world better I have learned that all <unk> are <unk> he put by his indignation , looked at me with immense solemnity , and teased his short chin beard .
“ So be it , my young companion .
You are a man of birth , and in every country under the stars a <unk> of that quality must be allowed his maggot .
<unk> is blood wherever it flows , whether it is in Arabia sitting in a <unk> without its shoes , or whether it is in England , drinking <unk> and eating <unk> with the <unk> <unk> .
I myself am of that condition , and therefore , good Spaniard , none is better acquainted with those <unk> <unk> that <unk> the minds of the nobly nurtured . ” “ These are good words , Sir Richard ; and if my name were other than Miguel Jesus Maria de Sarda y Boegas I would ask no better master for my two hands and my faithful service . ” “ Well , Master Miguel Jesus Maria de Sarda y Boegas , I never heard such proud speaking on eight crowns before .
If you had eight thousand I expect you would be a maker of <unk> .
But I am inclined to love you for it ; and therefore out of a gentle feeling propose to teach you the use of the sword .
First , I would have you hand me your old tuck . ” With a proper humility I gave him my sword .
“ Why , ” said he , making <unk> <unk> and passes with it , “ it would weary one of twice your stature .
It would require the giant Cormoran to wield it delicately .
It is a good thing but an ancient ; it is at least an hundred years behind the age . ” “ My noble father gave it into my hand as death closed his eyes , ” said I , feeling my pride to be surmounting my humility .
“ I expect your father was a very brave man , and as such I esteem him .
All the same , I should say that the <unk> was not more than half his estate . ” “ He was as wise a man as ever lived . ” “ As wise a Spaniard I make no doubt .
But the really wise men live in England .
It is also the home of the first swordsmen of the time .
You see , Master Miguel , there is no true felicity in anything without true mind .
That is why we English are so fortunate ; we have the mind and therefore the felicity .
Now , Master Miguel , I will show you how to fix your gripe upon your sword .
The wrist must be free , and the arm must have good play . ” For more than an hour this learned master expounded the rudiments of this weapon , which he swore by his beard I did not know .
He declared that every one of my father ’ s precepts , which I had to confess I had put to a poor use , would not have been new in the time of the Cid .
And although I had a mind to dispute this contempt for my father ’ s opinion , I did not venture , since I was quite unable to support the precepts of my youth with any fair ensample .
Indeed , only the highest presumption would have ventured to dispute with so arch a master of the noble weapon .
There appeared to be nothing <unk> to its nature and conduct that he did not know .
He said he had devoted his life to this study , and infinite practice , <unk> to the kindness of his stars , had given him an address that was incomparable .
There was one trick he performed which I often recall , with such wonder did it fill me .
He took from a scabbard which he kept under his eye in the chimney corner , a long , fine , and tapering Italian rapier , which he declared was the most perfect and poetic thing of man ’ s invention .
With no other weapon than this , he met my own sword in such a fashion that , heavy as it was , it seemed but as a lath before it .
Indeed I , its <unk> , was unable to make the least advance <unk> ; and to my amazement , with the might of his arm and this thin piece of steel , he urged me before him all over the room .
<unk> he rolled up the sleeve of his doublet with an air of pride , and showed the contour of that enormous limb .
“ Yet , Master Miguel , ” said he , “ it is not <unk> strength that makes the man you behold .
It is the <unk> of the fingers in <unk> with the brain ’ s <unk> . ” By the time my lesson was concluded the sweat had <unk> from every <unk> , and I was breathing heavily .
On the contrary , the Englishman , who had exerted himself not less greatly , was <unk> in any particular , save that of the throat , an inconvenience , however , which in his case seemed to be of a permanent character .
“ These <unk> , ” said he , “ I perform every day to keep the limbs supple and the wrists <unk> .
Sometimes , if I feel especially valiant , I place an apple or an <unk> upon the head of the old bull frog of an innkeeper , and <unk> it in four quarters with my broadsword , and to observe him <unk> as if he had the ague is the most delectable sight .
He is forever thinking that my honest blade will proceed too far , and <unk> through his mind ; and I conceive it to be my duty to assure him that he does well to show this concern , for sometimes accidents have been known to occur . ” He then offered very courteously to perform a like action to an apple placed upon my own head .
This , however , I declined with a courtesy which I hope was not less than his own .
Sir Richard Pendragon , having drunk copiously of his favourite <unk> out of his favourite cup , and having insisted that I should follow his example , said , -- “ Master Miguel , in what part of the globe do you intend to adventure to-morrow with your noble eight crowns ?
They will not bear you above a thousand leagues ; fortune does not grow on the <unk> , according to all that I have heard about it ; your stomach is too proud to take service with one who has the blood of kings flowing under his doublet ; so it would seem that unless you bring your chaste mind to the <unk> of <unk> and the cutting of throats , your body will starve . ” “ God <unk> , sir !
I have devices of my own .
I mind me of one of the finest and most <unk> of my father ’ s precepts . ” “ Not of <unk> , I trust ? ” “ No , sir , of conduct . ” “ Not of conduct of the sword , Master Miguel Jesus Maria de Sarda y <unk> I love the sound of that name ! --if I may put the question ? ” “ Not conduct of the sword , sir , conduct of the heart .
My father ’ s precept was this : ‘ In <unk> him you shall serve , rather let it be some high lord or gentleman of birth , diminished in his fortune , or in some sort isolated from his right estate , for it is the cause of the weak that <unk> the valiant . ’ ” It was pleasing to <unk> Sir Richard Pendragon nod his head in approval .
“ That was well observed of your father , Master Miguel .
I am rejoiced to notice that he knew a little more of mankind than he did of martial weapons .
But , by my sooth , you will not need to look above a thousand leagues for this high lord or gentleman of birth , diminished in his fortune , or in some sort isolated from his right estate . ” “ I am well pleased , ” said I eagerly , “ that he is so near at hand .
Where may he be , good Englishman ? ” “ He sits before you , gentle Spaniard , sipping a <unk> of sack out of a silver goblet on a three-legged stool . ” “ I would ask no better master , had the king ’ s blood in his veins been a true Spanish colour . ” “ Well , every man to his taste , ” said he , looking into his wine , “ but you Spaniards are very mad fellows .
The blood of Uthyr Pendragon , sire of Arthur , king and sovereign lord of Britain , not being to your mind , we must make abatement of this peninsularity of yours , and find some other . ” “ I would serve some Spanish gentleman of high degree , and if you can bring one to mind , Sir Englishman , who , diminished in his fortune , has a beauteous and enchanting <unk> ” “ Oho !
we have now in the case a beauteous and enchanting daughter !
Is that another of your father ’ s precepts , my son , or does it proceed out of your own wise pate ? ” “ The words of my father are these : ‘ <unk> your heart without haughtiness , but with bright ambition , upon some fair Spanish lady , one whose condition is the equal of her beauty , and whose figure in the world is of the first consideration , for so much superiority shall raise your spirit , my gentle kinsman , to vie with hers , and be , as it were , as that North <unk> that is fixed above the <unk> to point the course of fortune .
And further , gentle kinsman , I <unk> as follows : When your parts and situation are fit to vie with hers , the blood of a Sarda y Boegas shall make you the <unk> lord of this proud lady . ’ ” When I had given this further precept of my father ’ s , the Englishman sat laughing into his hands .
“ Why , this is the <unk> fellow , ” he said , as if to himself ; “ yet I like to hear these <unk> of his , because there is a kind of poetry in them , and there is no saying whither his maggot will be leading him next . ” “ I wish , sir , you could aid me in the quest of this nobleman I seek , and <unk> of this beautiful and enchanting lady . ” “ What should English Dick know of these noblemen you seek , and these beautiful and enchanting ladies , you mad varlet ? ” “ You know the world so <unk> .
I believe you are acquainted with every blade of grass that <unk> in it , and you appear to be familiar with every person of the first consideration that <unk> it . ” “ The varlet is not so mad after all , ” he said , with a sleek air .
“ Now and again there is sooth in him , although the rascal is always flying off into such odd ideas .
Yes , I am acquainted with the world a little , Don Miguel Jesus Maria de Sarda y <unk> name will be my doom ! --and although I know hardly anything that is good of that part of it which is oddly called <unk> most ridiculous <unk> name to my mind ! --I think I have heard of just the one person in it who will be the man for your services . ” “ A Spanish nobleman ? ” “ As full of nobility as a dog is of fleas .
<unk> I know not how many ; and as proud as the <unk> . ” “ Of what degree , sir ? ” “ A duke , to be sure .
Duke of <unk> as haughty as mine old and dear friend the Sophy . ” “ Is he diminished in his fortune , sir , and isolated from his right estate ? ” “ Yes , by my troth .
He is as bankrupt in his substance as he is in his wit .
Were he not well found in virtuous principles , he would be obliged to starve like a <unk> in a hard winter . ” “ And is this virtuous nobleman embroiled with an enemy ? ” “ Yes , good Don .
He hath been embroiled this long while with the King of Castile , his covetous nephew and bitter foe , who <unk> to add his fair castle and good lands above the city of Toledo to his own dominion .
And I may tell you , Spaniard , this Castilian is like to do it , unless some wise and cunning hand arises to deny him , for that piece of old punctilio , who <unk> nearer to <unk> every day , will soon be unable to <unk> him off . ” “ Can it be , ” I cried excitedly , “ that Heaven has called me to be this same wise and cunning hand ?
This looks uncommonly like a providence . ” “ Oh , my dear Don Miguel ! ” exclaimed the Englishman , breaking forth into another of his mighty roars of laughter , “ I pray you to take pity on these <unk> of mine .
If one of these days you do not lay me <unk> dead of an <unk> , there is not an <unk> of king ’ s blood in my nature . ” “ I am grievously surprised if my stars have not called me to some high destiny .
Don Ygnacio , my father , declared as he lay dying that it was so . ” “ I do fear me then , good Don , this high destiny of yours will declare itself late in the day .
You are as raw as a green <unk> .
You must be set on the <unk> to <unk> before you can be considered as a table fruit . ” “ You wrong me , good Sir Richard .
I am determined to prove myself as soon as another .
I may have no mind for stratagem , but I shall not be afeared to draw my sword for this worthy but unfortunate grandee . ” “ O Jesu ! ” said the English giant , laughing into his hands softly , “ I can feel this accursed fluxion mounting into my mind .
I can see perfectly well , Master Miguel , if we go our ways together about this peninsula of yours , I shall be compelled to travel with a physician .
Not afeared to draw your sword !
Why , good Don , your sword is a lath , and he who draws it has not a hair to his chin , and cannot bleat so loud as a Barbary sheep . ” “ <unk> me if you will , Sir Richard , but I will draw my sword for this grandee .
Fortune has <unk> it .
And tell me , in addition to these misfortunes of his , hath he a daughter of a most surpassing <unk> ? ” “ You can certainly count on his having a daughter .
<unk> all the world over are notorious <unk> of <unk> . ” I asked the Englishman the reason of this phenomenon .
“ It is a singular quality of their blood , ” he declared .
“ It <unk> its ambition and fills the world with <unk> . ” “ Indeed , ” said I , “ is that the case ?
But it doth truly appear that this virtuous Duke of Montesina was designed by Heaven that I might <unk> my father ’ s behests .
To-morrow , come what may , I will adventure towards his country ; and as you would have me believe that he hath a daughter , I must <unk> to appear before her . ” “ A pitiless old <unk> of <unk> , I dare swear , ” cried Sir Richard Pendragon .
“ There will not be a tooth in her mouth .
But now you have put me in mind of this duke , young sirrah , I think I will adventure thither myself .
For , upon my life , I have a crow to pluck with this King John of Castile .
I mind me it is high time I put paid to a score I owe him . ” “ Wherefore , Sir Richard ? ” “ Wherefore , my son ?
’ Tis but a year ago he threw the last of the Pendragons into a dungeon ; and had it not been for the ready contrivance of that meritorious mind in <unk> a hole through the wall with a nail out of his shoe , he would have ceased to drink sack this twelvemonth .
Yes , Spaniardo , it was a most villainous matter , and it is certainly time I put it in order . ” “ If I may ride with you , sir , I shall count it a proud day , ” said I , making a low bow ; for this strange man , with all his quiddity , was one whose company was to be esteemed in an early adventure into the world .
“ You shall , good Don , ” said he , smiling upon me with much civility .
“ And now let us draw our cloaks about us and creep into the chimney-place , and sleep the sleep of those who addict themselves to virtue .
You take one corner and I will take the other ; and let us pray that we sleep like doom , for I tell you , brother , it is a long and hard journey to Toledo . ” <unk> him <unk> the final dregs in his monstrous cup , which of late had begun to <unk> his speech a little , seeing him <unk> his cloak about him and otherwise suit his action to his words , I was fain to imitate him in these particulars .
<unk> into the warm corner of the chimney , for after the heat of the day the northern night was cold , fatigue overcame me at once , and I fell into a profound and delicious sleep .
CHAPTER VIII OF A GREAT CALAMITY I <unk> not even time to <unk> my prayers , which , considering what lay before me , were never so sorely needed , ere I was in a sweet <unk> .
Upon returning from this pleasant <unk> a <unk> sense of refreshment stole over my veins , for my slumber had been <unk> , and for several hours the sun had been in attendance on the morning .
The first thing I observed was my companion of the previous night .
He was seated on his stool , and was blowing with his mouth upon a <unk> of porridge .
“ Landlord , ” I heard him roar , “ if you do not bring me a cup of sack to cool my throat , which I have blistered already with your damnable <unk> , the <unk> will have fresh meat in their larder . ” He pointed this threat by thrusting his dagger into the loose earth which formed the floor .
“ Ha !
Spaniardo , ” said he , observing that I had opened my eyes , “ do I perceive you to be awake already ?
You have slept round the clock .
What a notable gift is that of youth . ” “ I give you good morrow , Sir Richard Pendragon , ” said I , rubbing the sleep out of my eyes and slowly recalling my situation .
Hardly had I done so than I remembered that eight crowns was my fortune , in an old piece of <unk> .
<unk> I pressed my hand where I had placed it last .
How shall I <unk> the terrible pang that seized me when I pressed and felt in vain .
I got up and looked all about my corner ; looked under the settle on which I had lain ; <unk> the dry earth which composed the floor ; felt in all my <unk> yet again , and even <unk> among the <unk> of the <unk> kindled fire .
But my purse was not .
I cannot tell you what a desperate pang overcame me when I discovered that I was <unk> of every <unk> I had in the world .
By the time I had concluded these <unk> the Englishman , who had been far too much employed with his breakfast to heed these actions , had taken himself off out of doors .
I was glad to find him gone ; and I proceeded to conduct my search in every corner of the place , in the vain hope that it had fallen from me in those <unk> passages of the previous night .
But I should have done as well to look in a <unk> for a precious stone .
I was standing with my hands <unk> in my doublet , and trying <unk> enough to confront my position , when the innkeeper entered .
I was hungry , yet I had no money with which to purchase a breakfast .
Further , I had not a friend ; I had not a home ; I was in a country as foreign to me as a distant land ; and I hardly dared in this predicament to turn to a stranger to crave a word of kindness .
And now did I feel so tender in my years , and so plainly did I discern that my experience of mankind was <unk> for my needs , that even as I stood I felt despair spread over me in a manner that I should have thought impossible .
So far was I from my valiancy of the previous evening that I nearly shed tears before the innkeeper when I mentioned to him my loss .
Now here you shall mark the difference between a man who has breeding and a man who has not .
No sooner did I confide my loss to the innkeeper and that I was left as penniless as a beggar , than this notorious <unk> , who the previous night had called for my aid , pulled the <unk> mouth I ever saw and looked upon me rudely .
“ Does Pedro understand by this , ” he said in a desperate tone of injury , “ that you will not pay him for your lodging and the quantities of wine and victual you had of him last night ? ” “ Not _ will not _ , <unk> _ cannot _ , ” said I miserably , not having now the spirit to defend myself from his <unk> .
“ I grieve to say I have not so much as a penny in the world .
The amount of my score must stand as a loan you have made to me , and I will not sleep of a night until you are <unk> .
I will <unk> a messenger to bring you your just due as soon as I can obtain it . ” “ Why , what words are these ? ” the innkeeper whined .
“ <unk> of a <unk> messenger !
Oh , by the Virgin Mary , I have been robbed and cheated !
Look here , you who <unk> to be a gentleman , I will have it out of you .
Pedro has been mishandled by such as you before this morning .
And oh , good Our Lady , how he did <unk> you , Pedro , when you told of this foreign cut-throat who for three weeks has used you the same . ” It made my ear burn , reader , that I , Miguel Jesus Maria de Sarda y Boegas , of the sangre azul of my native Asturias , should stand before this common fellow in the light of a rogue .
Yet in spite of the innkeeper ’ s hard words I strove to bear myself with patience and dignity , for it was ever my father ’ s opinion that Fortune is a <unk> mistress , who will <unk> humiliate her <unk> not so much to do them hurt , but to make proper trial of their fortitude .
Yet it was not my spirit alone that was to be <unk> in this affair ; my body was to be mortified also .
Having slept many hours , and being in the <unk> of a vigorous youth , I grew bitterly hungry .
“ Not a <unk> , not a <unk> , ” snarled the landlord , when I asked modestly enough that my breakfast and that of my horse might be <unk> up with the rest .
Now here it was that the brave little <unk> , who the previous evening had saved my life , came up to her master .
“ Give the young gentleman his wine and his porridge , ” said she , “ and , master , I myself will bear his charges . ” “ You , good wench ! ” I asked incredulously , for she was so ragged that she looked in worse case than myself .
“ Yes , young gentleman , I can pay , ” she answered proudly .
“ I make it a practice to save a hundred maravedis of my wages a year . ” “ Very well then , Casilda , ” said the innkeeper .
“ Fetch me fifty of your maravedis , and you may bring this young rogue his breakfast .
But you are a little fool , I say , for he is but a travelling cheat who will never <unk> you . ” No sooner had her master spoken thus to my <unk> than the kindly creature , who was really very handsome if you will believe me , reader , stood up most majestically upon all her few inches , and said like a little queen , -- “ <unk> upon you , master !
He is no cheat , but a very gentleman , with the sweetest face and an honest and kind expression , just like <unk> , our old mule .
